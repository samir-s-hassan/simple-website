# Simple Website v1

Simple Website is an app that employs basic HTML and CSS to launch a very simple webpage. The webpage has basic information about my life. It also tells a story about a young soccer player, Pedri, (one of my favorite soccer players). Though, the story is not realistic but I'd imagine that's how Pedri's life would be at Lehigh.
